Extra Javascript Practice
I get a lot of questions about how you can practice and learn more Javascript (the core concept that you really want to master if you want to be a Developer). Anyway, I wanted to share with you the 3 free resources that I recommend. In my opinion they offer incredible insight into Javascript and are better than most paid options out there. They will really solidify your knowledge if you do them along with the course, in your spare time, or throughout your career:

1. https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS
2. http://javascript.info/
3. http://dmitrysoshnikov.com/ecmascript/javascript-the-core-2nd-edition/

or... you can scroll all the way to the bottom of this course to Extras: Bonus Part 2 to see some more Advanced JS that I teach :)




Optional Exercise: Javascript Logic
What is the Challenge?
Solve the below 3 javascript puzzles. The goal of this challenge is to practice our logic skills. Something that is useful not only in interviews when you get challenging problems, but also in your day to day work as a developer. First, start off by reading this article: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2

Question 1: Clean the room function: given an input of [1,2,4,591,392,391,2,5,10,2,1,1,1,20,20], make a function that organizes these into individual array that is ordered. For example answer(ArrayFromAbove) should return: [[1,1,1,1],[2,2,2], 4,5,10,[20,20], 391, 392,591]. Bonus: Make it so it organizes strings differently from number types. i.e. [1, "2", "3", 2] should return [[1,2], ["2", "3"]]

Question 2: Write a javascript function that takes an array of numbers and a target number. The function should find two different numbers in the array that, when added together, give the target number. For example: answer([1,2,3], 4)should return [1,3]

Question 3: Write a function that converts HEX to RGB. Then Make that function auto-dect the formats so that if you enter HEX color format it returns RGB and if you enter RGB color format it returns HEX.
